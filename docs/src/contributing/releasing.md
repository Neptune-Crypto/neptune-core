# Releasing Neptune Core

This section describes the steps to publish a new version of Neptune Core, and to release & distribute its binary artifacts.

## Pre-requisites

The following tools are used to ensure a high quality release.

- [cargo-binstall](https://github.com/cargo-bins/cargo-binstall) ‚Äì Faster installation of the needed tools (optional)
- [cargo-semver-checks](https://github.com/obi1kenobi/cargo-semver-checks/) ‚Äì Scans the crate for [semver](https://semver.org/) violations
- [git cliff](https://git-cliff.org/docs/) ‚Äì Simplifies changelog creation
- [cargo-release](https://github.com/crate-ci/cargo-release) ‚Äì Simplifies simultaneous publication of multiple crates
- [dist](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/introduction.html) ‚Äì Creates installers and publishes them in a [GitHub release](https://github.com/Neptune-Crypto/neptune-core/releases)

Use the following commands to install the needed tools.
If you decide against using `cargo binstall`, it's generally possible to just `cargo install` instead.
Some tools might require `cargo install --locked`.

```sh
cargo install cargo-binstall
cargo binstall cargo-semver-checks
cargo binstall git-cliff
cargo binstall cargo-release
cargo binstall cargo-dist
```

## Release Process Checklist

Not every step of the release process is (or should be) fully automated.
An example of a semi-automated step is changelog generation.
Tools like `git cliff` help, but a manual edit is necessary to reduce noise and achieve the polish appreciated by readers of the changelog.
An example of a fully automated step is assembly and distribution of binaries by `dist`.

### Set Working Directory to Workspace Root

Unless indicated otherwise, the current working directory is assumed to be the workspace root.

```sh
cd /path/to/neptune-core
```

### Bump Version

Bump the version in `Cargo.toml` [as appropriate](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/semver.html).

### Confirm Version Bump as Semantic

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Because binaries cannot be used as a dependency, this step is only relevant if Neptune Core has library targets.
<!---
    At the time of writing, there are no library targets.
    Remove the note above if there is a library target.
    Remove every mention to `cargo-semver-checks` if it is certain that Neptune Core will never have library targets.
--->

Make sure that the version bump conforms to semantic versioning.

```sh
cargo semver-checks
```

### Generate Changelog Addition

Summarize the changes introduced since the last version.
Consistent use of [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) and `git cliff` get you started:

```sh
git cliff v0.0.1..HEAD -t vX.Y.Z > /tmp/change_diff.md
#         ~~~~~~~          ~~~~~~
#            |             the to-be-released version
#            |
#         at least 2 versions back for the GitHub ‚Äúcompare‚Äù link to work
```

If new commit types were introduced since the last release, `git cliff` will not know about them.
You can recognize the commit types unknown to `git cliff` by the missing associated emoji in the corresponding headline in the generated changelog addition.
Add the new commit types to `cliff.toml` and rerun the above command.

### Polish the Changelog Addition

Make the changelog addition (`/tmp/change_diff.md`) concise.
This is a manual step.

Feel free to delete entries generously.
For example, a branch that builds up to a certain feature might have a series of commits that are relevant for development and review.
Users of Neptune Core probably only care about the feature itself;
they should not be bombarded with minute details of its development process.
Should they be interested in more details, the changelog will have a link to the commit that introduced the feature.
From there, they can start their own journey of discovery.

If you find an entry in the changelog addition confusing or irrelevant, then with high probability, so will users of Neptune Core;
delete the changelog entry, or investigate its meaning and rewrite it.

Focus only on the new version, even though the changelog addition contains sections for older versions.
The changelogs for those older versions are already in the `CHANGELOG.md`, and should probably not be touched.

### Amend `CHANGELOG.md`

Copy the now-polished changelog addition from `/tmp/change_diff.md` into `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Commit

Add and commit the changed files.

```sh
git add Cargo.toml
git add CHANGELOG.md
git commit -m "chore: Release vX.Y.Z"
#                              ~~~~~
#                              the new version
```

### Ensure that Tests Pass

Make sure all tests pass, preferably by waiting for [GitHub's CI](https://github.com/Neptune-Crypto/neptune-core/actions) to finish.
Alternatively, run them locally:

```sh
cargo test --all-targets
```

### Publish to `crates.io`

The tool `cargo-release` helps to publish multiple, possibly inter-depending crates with a single command.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è If the workspace has only one member, `cargo publish` (instead of `cargo release`) works fine.
>    With `cargo publish`, you will need to create git tags manually.
<!---
    At the time of writing, the Neptune Core workspace has only one member crate.
    Remove the note above if there is more than one workspace member.
    Remove every mention to `cargo-release` if it is certain that Neptune Core will always have only one workspace member.
--->

```sh
cargo release --execute --no-push
#             ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~
#                 |     gives you time to review the created git tag(s)
#                 |
#             omit this to get a dry run
```

### Push to GitHub

In the previous step, `cargo-release` automatically created one or multiple git tags.
Edit them until you are happy (which probably means no editing), then push the tags to GitHub.

```sh
cargo release --execute push
```

> üéâ Congrats on the new release!

### Distribute Binaries

Oh‚Ä¶ distributing binaries?
That's all handled by [`dist`](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/introduction.html)!
After CI [has done its job](https://github.com/Neptune-Crypto/neptune-core/actions), check the [release page](https://github.com/Neptune-Crypto/neptune-core/releases) if everything looks okay.

To modify which systems the binaries & installers are built for, run [`dist init`](https://opensource.axo.dev/cargo-dist/book/quickstart/rust.html#adding-installers).
