# Bootstrapping from Raw Block Files

Instead of starting the state from the genesis block and requesting all blocks from peers, the `neptune-core` node can bootstrap its state from a directory containing raw block data.

This can be done by using the `--bootstrap-from-directory=<DIR>` CLI argument when launching `neptune-core`. The directory must contain raw block data of the form generated by the node during normal operations. The file names should have the form `blk0.dat`, `blk1.dat` etc.

Once the node has read all blocks this way, the directory containing the block data used for bootstrapping can be deleted, as the process copies all block data.

By default, the blocks read this way will be validated. Skipping this validation step can speedup initial synchronization significantly. To skip the validation step, add the argument `--disable-bootstrap-block-validation`. If you skip the validation step, this process can no longer be considered trustless, and `neptune-core` may end up in an unrecoverable state if the source data is somehow corrupted.
