// RustyValue is an interface for serializing data as bytes for storing
// in the database.  See type description below.
//
// RustyValue now makes use of `bincode` for serializing data.
// Any rust `serializer` crate that understands serde
// Serialize and Deserialize traits could be plugged in instead.
//
// Here is a good comparison of rust serializers and their performance/size.
//  https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark
// See also this blog:
//  https://david.kolo.ski/blog/rkyv-is-faster-than/
//
// An important consideration is that many of these crates are not
// compatible with `serde`.   of those that are, `bincode` and `postcard`
// appear to be the fastest options, and are pretty close.
// `postcard` seems to create smaller serialized data size though,
// so that could be a good reason to use it for a large DB like
// a blockchain.  `ron` appears too slow to be a good option.
//
// With regards to blockchain size, we should also consider
// compressing our serialized data with something like zlib.
// In the above benchmarks, all libraries are compared with
// both uncompressed size and zlib compressed size.
//
// The fn that does the compression in the benchmark is:
//  https://github.com/djkoloski/rust_serialization_benchmark/blob/e1f6a31a431d5e8c3889525696231acbb691cbd9/src/lib.rs#L169
//
// For RustyValue, we would do the compression/decompression in the
// `serialize` and `deserialize` functions.
//
// Before making final decision(s), we should benchmark our
// code with real data and try out different crates/options.
//
// todo: consider moving the serialization functions, or perhaps all
// of rusty_value.rs to a top level module, eg twenty-first::serialization.
