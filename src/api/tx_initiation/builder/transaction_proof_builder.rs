//! This module implements a builder for transaction proofs.
//!
//! There are different levels of [TransactionProof] that
//! can be generated.  The desired proof can be specified with [TransactionProofType].
//!
//! With exception of `TransactionProofType::PrimitiveWitness`, proof generation
//! is a very CPU and RAM intensive process.  Each type of proof has different
//! hardware requirements.  Also the complexity is affected by the type and size
//! of transaction.
//!
//! Before a transaction can be confirmed in a block it must have a SingleProof
//! which is the hardest proof to generate.
//!
//! see [Transaction Initiation Sequence](super::super#transaction-initiation-sequence)
//!
//! If you have a powerful enough machine, you can generate a ProofCollection or
//! SingleProof yourself before passing the transaction to neptune-core.  This
//! takes load off the entire network and may lower the transaction fee
//! requirements.
//!
//! see [Client Provides Proof Initiation Sequence](super::super#client-provides-proof-initiation-sequence)
//!
//! see [builder](super) for examples of using the builders together.
