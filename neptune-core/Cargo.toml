[features]

# logs write-lock acquisitions that are held over 100 millis.  requires nightly.
# to enable: cargo +nightly build --features log-slow-write-lock
# note: nothing logged until lock is released (guard dropped)
# alternative: run tokio-console

# logs read-lock acquisitions that are held over 100 millis.  requires nightly.
# to enable: cargo +nightly build --features log-slow-read-lock
# note: nothing logged until lock is released (guard dropped)
# alternative: run tokio-console
log-slow-read-lock = ["track-lock-location", "track-lock-time"]

# logs all lock events (try_acquire, acquire, release).
# useful for debugging deadlocks, or if a lock is never being released.
# includes acquisition location if track-lock-location feature is enabled.
# alternative: run tokio-console
log-lock_events = ["track-lock-location"]

# locks::sync::tokio support for tracking location of lock acquisition
# requires nightly.  not generally useful by itself.

# locks::sync::tokio support for tracking instant of lock acquisition

# implements arbitrary::Arbitrary for various types

[dependencies]

# note: arbitrary, proptest, proptest-arbitrary-interop are duplicated in [dev-dependencies]
# because they are optional deps but required for unit tests.
# please ensure versions match in both sections.
