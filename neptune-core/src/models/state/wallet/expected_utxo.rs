/// represents utxo and secrets necessary for recipient to claim it.
///
/// [ExpectedUtxo] is intended to inform the wallet of UTXOs that were confirmed
/// or are about to be confirmed, that it can claim. For example:
///  - change outputs,
///  - coinbase UTXOs (produced by the miner)
///  - incoming off-chain transaction notifications.
///
/// The on-chain notifications follow a completely different code path and never
/// touch [ExpectedUtxo]s.
///
/// The `ExpectedUtxo` will exist in the local
/// [RustyWalletDatabase](super::rusty_wallet_database::RustyWalletDatabase)
/// from the time the transaction is sent until it is mined in a block and
/// claimed by the wallet.
///
/// note that when using `ExpectedUtxo` there is a risk of losing funds because
/// the wallet stores this state on disk and if the associated file(s) are lost
/// then the funds cannot be claimed.
///
/// an alternative is to use onchain symmetric keys instead, which uses some
/// blockchain space and may leak some privacy if a key is ever used more than
/// once.
///
/// Objects of this type are not intended to be transmitted; they only ever live
/// locally in the client's memory or disk. The main use of this thing
///
/// ### about `receiver_preimage`
