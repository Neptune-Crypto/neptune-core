//! Provides simplified tokio lock types for sharing data between threads

// note: twenty-first::sync has equivalent wrappers for std::sync types.
//       It would make sense to put these tokio wrappers there also except
//       that twenty-first presently has no tokio dependency and I didn't
//       really want to introduce one just for this.  So that's why they are
//       here instead.  We may wish to revisit in the future, and maybe
//       put all the sync types in their own crate.
